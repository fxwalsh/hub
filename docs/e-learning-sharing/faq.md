## Application / Enrollment

### How can I enroll for a course?

In order to enroll for a course, you must send an application to the StudyATHome team. **After the application deadline**, the application will be approved (**nomination**) by the coordinators of the home university (see [selection criteria](#what-are-the-applicant-selection-criteria)) and forwarded to the coordinators of the host university, by e-mail.

You can enroll for a course by clicking the ```Enroll Now``` button on the details page of the course. Then you will get to the [enrollment page](/courses/enroll/).

1. Select the home university (your university)
2. Select the course

### What are the applicant selection criteria?

The applicants will be nominated by their international coordinators using the following criteria:

1. Students must be in the 3^rd^ semester when doing the virtual exchange. The application can be done earlier already.
2. Grade Point Average (arithmetic average) of previously finished semester. E.g. When applying for an exchange in the 3^rd^ semester, the grades of the 1^st^ semester will be considered.

### The course starts before my semester start. Can I enroll nevertheless?

Yes. Just in case, you can ask your program lead or the responsible person at your university.

### What level of English language proficiency do I require?

No certification is required. English language proficiency is deemed acceptable if the relevant coordinator of your International Office approves it.

### Are the courses for free?

Yes, the courses are **free of charge**.

### How many participants will be accepted?

The courses typically have a capacity of **5 participants**.

## Grading

### Do I have to do an exam or assignments?

Yes. The actual number of assignments and exams is dependent on the course. You can find the information about grading at the respective details page of the course.

### What does a typical exam/assessment look like?

This depends on the course and the lecturer. This can be for example an online multiple choice test or an oral exam using video conferencing.  

### What does a typical assignment look like?

An assignment is typically a graded exercise, where your result must be uploaded to the learning management system of the course. The lecturer might schedule a video conference to proof the authenticity of your result.

### What if I fail the exam?

You are registered as a regular student at the host university and have the same rights and duties as such. If you fail, you will have to redo respective assignments and/or exams until you pass the course. The number of attempts and dates should be announced by the lecturers of the course. If all attempts fail, you will not be able to get grades for recognition at your home university.

::: note
Please be aware that failing the course will eventually require you to do a regular course of your study program, instead. This could impact your overall study progress.
