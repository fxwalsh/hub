# Audio Engineering

::: slot information
This integrated course provides students the opportunity to familiarise themselves with the basics of acoustics and audio engineering, including perception of sound, microphones, amplifiers, loudspeakers, audio processing, etc. 
:::

## Overview

### Contents

- Sound and sound attributes
- Human perception of sound
- Signal chain in audio engineering
- Microphones and amplifiers
- Analog vs digital signals
- Fourier Analysis, Spectrum, Spectrogram
- Synthesis of sounds
- Filters
- Audio compression
- Lourspeakers

### Outcomes

Participants of this course will learn how to

- Understand the signal chain in a typical audio application, and be able to recognise and avoid distortions in all stages
- Understand how humans perceive sound,
- Record sounds using the appropriate equipment,
- Measure different attributes of sound and understand how they correlate to human perception,
- Analyse and interpret recorded sounds
- Synthesise sounds with specific attributes
- Perform audio processing on recordings
- Understand how audio compression works

### Methods

The Lecturer will explain some basic concepts.
The students will complete tasks in the computer using Matlab.
