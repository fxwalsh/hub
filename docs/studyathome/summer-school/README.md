## About

**ASSIST HEIDI brings students and people with disabilities together**, in order to design and prototype an individual assistive technology solution for them.
Students will have access to materials, tools and equipment (e.g. 3D printer etc.).
The Smart Living Lab and the IoT Lab of UAS Technikum Wien provide the perfect environment for the participants.
This is the best opportunity to get to know people with disabilities, to contribute, develop and implement your own ideas.

## Project Work

In the first half of the Summer School different topics are presented including small exercises.
The project ideas will be worked on from the second half of the Summer School.
Depending on the number of participants, the students work in groups of 3-5 people to implement a project.
During the group or idea-finding phase, participants can contribute their own ideas based on personal experience.
