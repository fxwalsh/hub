funded by the City of Vienna (grant-nr. 22-07) deals with the development and implementation of internationalization at home measures at the UAS Technikum Wien.
In the course of this, we provide a web platform ("StudyATHome Hub") to support the sharing of eLearning courses between partner universities.
The platform lists courses and assists with the enrollment process.
For research purposes, participants will be asked to fill out a questionaire before and after the participation.

## Data Flow

After successful completion of the course, the International Office of the home university will get a digital copy of your transcript of records.

You can announce this revocation at any time by informal mail to [studyathome\@technikum-wien.at](mailto:studyathome@technikum-wien.at).
