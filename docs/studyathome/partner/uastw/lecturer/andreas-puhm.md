# Andreas Puhm

Andreas was born in 1982 in Vienna. During his study in Electronics on the University of Applied Science Technikum Wien he joined the Vienna Cubes Robocup team which participated in the Robocup WM 2005 in Osaka, Japan. In this project he found his interest for Embedded Systems.
He finished his Electronics study in 2006 as Dipl. Ing. (FH) and finished a Master study in Embedded Systems on the Technikum Wien in 2008.

In 2006 he joined the [Automotive Gateway](http://embsys.technikum-wien.at/projects/coordes/index.php) project team on the Technikum Wien as assistant.
In 2008 he worked on a industrial project with [Zelisko](http://www.zelisko.at) on building a PC/104 based LED Display Matrix for highways.
From 2008 to 2011 he has been working in the [COORDES](http://embsys.technikum-wien.at/projects/coordes/index.php) project with a focus on ASIC toolflow (UMC 90nm process) and design.
In 2011 he aided [Sensor Dynamics (now part of Maxim)](http://www.maxim-ic.com/landing/index.mvp?lpk=129) in the verification of an ASIC design.

From 2011 till 2013 he has been working on the [TWASIC](http://embsys.technikum-wien.at/projects/twasic/index.php) project with the goal to provide an ASIC toolflow for the AMS 350nm process technology which can be used for other R&D and also for master student projects.
Direct output of this project is a 8051 implementation which is also planned to be used in lectures as demonstration material.
As a result of this project in Februar 2013 the TW8051 has been successfully tested and is currently incorporated into lecture units of the UAS Technikum Wien.

From 2013 till 2018 he has been working in the [Josef Ressel Zentrum for Verification of Embedded Computing Systems](http://embsys.technikum-wien.at/projects/vecs/index.php) on clock synchronization in distributed embedded systems.
In a cooperation with Bluetechnix Gmbh (now part of BECOM) a set of four BlackFin DSP based [Time-of-flight Cameras](https://www.becom-group.com/en/becom-systems/3d-time-of-flight-cameras/) was synchronized via IEEE 1588.
In a cooperation with [Oregano Systems Design & Consulting GesmbH](https://www.oreganosystems.at/) their clock synchronization technology based on IEEE 1588 has been evaluated for application in the power industry, specifically for seamless redundancy systems (HSR & PRP, as specified by IEC 62439-3).

Since 2018 he is working in the [Josef Ressel Zentrum for Innovative Platforms for Electronic-Based Systems (INES)](https://embsys.technikum-wien.at/projects/ines/index.php) in cooperation with [Oregano Systems Design & Consulting GesmbH](https://www.oreganosystems.at/) on the various topics centered on hardware (FPGA) supported IEEE 1588 clock synchronization.

Beside that he is holding lectures on VHDL and Distributed Systems (FlexRay).
