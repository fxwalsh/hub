# Roman Beneder

Roman Beneder was born 1985.
After graduation at the HTL in Wien 20 ([TGM](http://www.tgm.ac.at/)) and attending his military service he started with the bachelor program in Electronics Engineering at the [UAS Technikum Wien](/studyathome/partner/uastw/) in 2006.
Till 2007 he was working as a part-time employee at the Research Group Embedded Systems.

In November 2009 he started working as a full-time employee within the R&D Project [Embedded Platforms](http://embsys.technikum-wien.at/projects/EmbPlat/index.php) funded by the MA23.
In this project he was co-responsible for developing a new microcontroller platform for various courses dedicated to embedded systems software engineering he wrote different learning letters which can be used within this courses.
To that end, his [master's thesis](https://embsys.technikum-wien.at/staff/beneder/0910297001_Beneder_CMARMJTAG.pdf) focused on the development of a [Cortex-M3](http://www.arm.com/products/processors/cortex-m/cortex-m3.php)-based debugger which is a key-component of the [eStick2](http://embsys.technikum-wien.at/staff/beneder/eStick2.php).

In December 2012 he joined the project FFG Innovation Cheque [dandel.io](http://dandel.io/) where he was co-responsible for redesigning the printed circuit board and setting up a development environment for further software development.

In May 2013 he started to work within the R&D Project [Josef Ressel Center for Verification of Embedded Computing Systems](http://vecs.technikum-wien.at/).
He is co-responsible for implementing a verification unit on Embedded Linux based devices.
These devices are provided by the company [Loytec GmbH](http://www.loytec.com/de) which are active on the home automation market.

In April 2015 he started to work within the public funded project [OpenLab](http://embsys.technikum-wien.at/projects/openlab/index.php), which goals are mainly focused on the development of low-cost, open-source, embedded measurement equipment for various courses at the [UAS Technikum Wien](/studyathome/partner/uastw/).

In November 2018 he started to work within the industry-cooperation "Emerging Applications Lab" funded by Infineon Austria Technologies GmbH.
The main focus of this industry-cooperation is the software development for unmanned aerial vehicles based on multicore microcontrollers and AIML platforms.
