## Academics

SETU is the major provider of higher education in the South East region of Ireland and one of the largest IOT’s in Ireland. The Institute’s range and scope reflect the changing needs of the southeast as well as the country as a whole.

The range of academic programmes is exceptionally extensive, ranging from Higher Certificate right through to post-doctoral research and covering the Humanities, Health and Nursing, Science and Informatics, Engineering and Architecture, Business and Education.

## Exchange Programme

South East Technological University (SETU) has inter-institutional agreements with over 100 universities within the EU and over 25 universities internationally. Every year we welcome over 200 students on our Erasmus+ and International Exchange Programmes into our Schools of Business, Humanities, Science, Engineering and Health Sciences.

Erasmus+ is for students attending our partner institutes within the EU and the International Exchange Programme is for students attending our partner institutes outside the EU.
Both Exchange Programmes provide opportunities for students from all over the world to join and contribute to our vibrant, multicultural community at SETU.
Spending a few months in a different culture and community is the best opportunity to establish intercultural contacts, have a valuable insight into a different culture, learn a language and grow as a person.

There are many benefits for SETU also. Two of the most important are: having a diverse community that enriches our own students' learning experience and building our international connectivity for the next generation.
